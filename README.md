Zachary Burpee repository for Adv. Big Data Analytics &amp; Ai final project. 
  
My project aims to automate the tedious,  and often highly-skilled, process of dynamic asset allocation - with respect to retail and commercial investments. I will evaluate the historical performance of market trends and extract important information that can lead to more profitable investments, support a variable risk tolerance, and be prepared for any market trend reversals. Additionally, I will provide customers with an evaluation of their portfolio, provide a more profitable spread, and have an automated system to execute trades with optimal precision and success. The final results of the project were successful, yielding an increase in profits year-over-year in excess of 100%. My strategy yielded a 121% return, while other allocation strategies only yielded a 10.5% return.
